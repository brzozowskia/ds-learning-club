My activities for [data science learning club](http://becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub)

## Activities

Learning activities for which I have written blog posts can be found [here](http://blog.haunschmid.name/tag/learning-club/)

The activities that are contained in this repo are explained in the following sections.

### Activity 02 - Creating Visuals for Exploratory Data Analysis

[Forum post](http://becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-91.html)

Contains visualisations of NFL data, mainly focusing on teams.

### Activity 05 - Naive Bayes classification

[Forum post](http://becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/thread-132.html)

Performed Naive Bayes on the [mushroom data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)

Wrote report in rmarkdown.

### Activity 07 - Linear regression

Performed Linear Regression on [salary dataset](data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary)

Wrote report in rmarkdown.
Shows use of ggplot, ggpairs (GGally), reshape2, lm
Deals with correlation, visualisation of data (numeric+categoric), details of lm(), computation & visualisation of train & test error

### Activity 16 - Genetic algorithms

I based my implementation on the notebook [Computing the optimal road trip across the U.S.](https://github.com/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/optimal-road-trip/Computing%20the%20optimal%20road%20trip%20across%20the%20U.S..ipynb) by (c) Randal S. Olson ([http://www.randalolson.com/](http://www.randalolson.com/), [rhiever on github](https://github.com/rhiever)). ([License info](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

I ported his algorithm to R and used the data that is stored by his notebook as a .tsv file. The code performs a genetic algorithm on a data set of US cities to find the shortest distance to visit all cities.
